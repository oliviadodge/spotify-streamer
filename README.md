# spotify-streamer
This is my repository for projects 1 and 2 of Udacity's Android Nanodegree program. The goal was to build a music-player app that uses the Spotify API to search for artists and tracks and play track previews.
Features include: artists and top tracks list fragments; preview player fragment with MediaPlayer; support for tablet layout; content provider; data loaders; and SQLite database.
